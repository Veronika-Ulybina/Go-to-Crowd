        <div class="market-overview__block-text">
          <p>Over the next 25 years, baby-boomers will pass $68 trillion to their children — the greatest inter-generational wealth transfer in history. The recipient demographic is technology-savvy, welcomes change and disruption, and is a demonstrated early adopter of financial technology (fintech) solutions. At the same time, legacy financial markets and institutions lack the agility and willingness to be first-movers with new technologies. The rapid rise of decentralized blockchain technology is an early indicator that the next generation of financial technology and asset management will need to exist on these digital rails.</p>
          <p>Hermesus is a newly formed, privately held fintech startup organized in Wyoming with a clear vision for the future of digital currency. We are determined to make a place for a USA-based trading platform in the digital assets market. Our team has invested years working on technology and compliance development. Our result is Hermesus: a next generation digital asset trading platform.</p>
          <p>The Hermesus platform was created with the digital currency investment community at heart and in mind. Hermesus brings new and improved technology to help solve existing limitations, create new markets, address unmet market needs, and create value for our participants. Our goal is to provide our users with cost-effective and user-friendly access to digital currencies and digital assets. Our platform has a competitive fee schedule and includes secure digital currency custody services.</p>
          <p>Since the launch of First Digital Currency in 2009, there has been consistent growth of the number of accounts at digital currencies service providers reflecting adoption rates of digital currencies. We see clear resemblances between the adoption rates of digital assets and that of Internet usage. We therefore anticipate a similar rate of adoption of digital currencies in the near to medium term. By our estimations, the digital currency market is anticipated to grow at least 4x over the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>Our research suggests that approximately 295 million user accounts have been created at digital currency service providers, representing an estimated minimum 106 million ID-verified users.</p>

          <p>Currently, there are over 600 globally exchanges compared to ~70 just five years ago.</p>
          <p>Some major global digital currency exchanges have been able to add more than 100,000 users per day.</p>
          <p>The global digital currency market generated about $1,500 million in 2021 in revenues and is anticipated to grow over 6.9% per year to over $2,300 million by 2028.</p>
          <p>Bloomberg estimates that the top 10 digital exchanges generate up to $3 million/day in trading fees, which roughly translates to over $1 billion per year.</p>
          <p>Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange, recently revealed that it had completed more than 14.5 million transactions on a single day. Binance has more than 29 million registered users.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the digital trading markets are anticipated to experience substantial revenue growth as more and more users adopt digital currencies (from 15% in 2022 to over 20% by 2029). Assuming trade execution fees remain stable, aggregate digital currency trading platform revenues are anticipated to grow at a similar rate.</p>

          <p>Developing new technologies for customer digital asset custody and matching them with current US laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>Banks can now offer digital currency and digital asset custody to their clients, but what does this really mean?</p>
          <p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently announced that nationally chartered banks in the U.S. can now enter into the digital asset custody arena. There are plenty of opinions about what impact this will have on the industry, and many of them are at odds.</p>
          <p>Some commentators feel this is the beginning of a new era for the industry where banks will be able to offer complimentary digital asset services attractive to sophisticated investors.</p>
          <p>But traditional financial institutions, banks included, move slowly. So, we don’t expect any to announce their brand new custody platform immediately, if at all. Moreover, banks and other sophisticated players in the old school markets have not moved to adopt blockchain technology or digital currencies. Most nationally chartered banks will not risk their current business by learning how to deal with private keys and offering such services without letting the industry mature. According to a recent Fidelity survey, only about a third of all these firms even own any digital assets.</p>
          <p>While banks are generally unwilling to enter the digital asset space, many investors in are not comfortable with the “Be-Your-Own-Bank” approach and take on the risk of storing their own digital currencies. Hermesus can help.</p>
